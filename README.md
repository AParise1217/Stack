 Assignment Overview:
 
 Using the linked list (MyLinkedList) created in Assignment 3.1, 
  create a stack class and a test program to display 
  the first 50 Fibonacci numbers in descending order. 
  Use a stack to store these numbers. Once 50 numbers have been computed,
  print the numbers in a descending order. You will note that this 
  process is naturally recursive. Therefore, use recursion to find 
  this series of Fibonacci numbers.
